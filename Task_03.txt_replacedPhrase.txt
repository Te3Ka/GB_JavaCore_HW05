This 1-dimensional array is used to get the current value for any будильникs that the instance may have, or it can be used to set those будильникs. There are twelve будильникs built into each instance of an object, and each one has its own event that will run when this variable reaches 0.

Alarms are counted down at the start of each step, after the Begin Step event but before the main Step event, and before anything is rendered for the frame. This means that if you set an будильник to 1 in the Begin Step event, its event will run in that same frame (as the будильник will be counted down to 0 after Begin Step has finished), but if you set an будильник to 1 in the Step event, it will run in the next frame.

It should be noted that the будильник is not finished when it reaches 0 (although the event has been triggered) as the next step it will go down to -1, so if you need to stop an будильник for any reason you should set its array value to -1 not 0. Alarm times are calculated in game steps, with a value of 30 being 30 steps, 60 being 60 steps, etc.
